## Unlocking BIM Inside Rhino/Grasshopper with Open Standards

**IfcHopperShell** is an open-source toolkit designed to empower Rhino/Grasshopper users, by enabling the direct use of IfcOpenShell within Grasshopper.

With **IfcHopperShell**, Rhino/Grasshopper transforms into a fully-fledged authoring software for BIM workflows, bridging the worlds of parametric design and open BIM.

## Key Features
- Open-source and Free: always open, always accessible to everyone.
- Python-powered Nodes: simple yet powerful components written in Python, ready for customization and extension.
- IFC-native Geometry: build, modify, and analyze IFC geometry directly inside Grasshopper.
- Bidirectional Workflow: achieve seamless data exchange between BIM and parametric design — all within open standards.
- Built on IfcOpenShell: leverage the robust capabilities of IfcOpenShell, now inside your favourite generative design environment.
- Extensible by the Community: collaborative and community-driven—everyone is welcome to contribute new tools and features for smarter, faster IFC modeling.

## Why IfcHopperShell?
Building open and interoperable BIM workflows should be accessible to all designers, engineers, and developers. With **IfcHopperShell**, you can:
Model IFC entities directly in Grasshopper
Author and refine BIM information without switching software
Accelerate design iteration in a truly connected BIM ↔ parametric workflow
Rely on open-source tools and standards for transparency and long-term viability
Participate in shaping the future of BIM authoring in Rhino/Grasshopper

## Get Involved!
**IfcHopperShell** is a community project—help us grow and improve!
